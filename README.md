HTML&CSS coding

A new design, based on the principles of Material Design, has just been created by Lo√Øc, a UI designer.

There would be two models made: one desktop and one mobile. The site must also be optimised for tablet devices. We are free to make the necessary changes for tablets. 

It is critical that no elements are cut and that the text is of sufficient size.

Regarding breakpoints, we agreed with UI designer that we would use 992px and 768px. 992px for computer screens, 768px for tablets and below 768 for mobile phones.

There should be no use of a CSS framework (such as BootStrap or Tailwind CSS) or CSS preprocessor (such as Sass or Less).
